# Fruit-Pickers
This project is for AUCSC 401 from the University of Alberta, Augustana Campus. This project will involve the creation of a website to bring the community of Camrose, Alberta together through the process of fruit picking. Our goal is to create a place where individuals looking for -- and offering -- fruit can make this connection. Ultimately, we wish to build a community of fruit picking in the real world.
