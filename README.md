# Camrose Fruit Share

#### *Live At https://www.camrosefruitshare.ca!*

This project is for AUCSC 401 - Professional Practicum - from the University of Alberta, Augustana Campus. 

This project involves the creation of a webapp using JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL to bring the community of fruit pickers in Camrose, Alberta together. Our goal is to create a place where individuals looking for -- and offering -- fruit can make this connection. Ultimately, we wish to build a community of fruit picking in the real world.

Created by Alex Ho, Justin Ikenouye, and Chase Larocque, University of Alberta.
